            ## üì¶ Installation

            Download `sha256sums.txt` as well as an appropriate archive that
            suits your operating system and architecture. Then follow the
            instructions of your operating system below.

            **NOTE**: Make sure to replace `[ARCH]` with your corresponding
            architecture.

            ### üêß Linux

            1. Verify checksums

               ```bash
               sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt
               ```

               **NOTICE**: You might see `No such file or directory` warning
               which is fine as long as there is an `OK` in front of the
               archive you've downloaded.

            2. Extract the downloaded archive.

               - Gzip

               ```bash
               tar -xzf climan-linux-[ARCH].tar.gz
               ```

               - Zip

               ```bash
               unzip climan-linux-[ARCH].zip
               ```

            3. Install the included files

               ```bash
               cd climan-linux-[ARCH]
               sudo install -Dm755 bin/climan /usr/local/bin/climan
               ```

            ### üçé MacOS

            1. Verify checksums

               ```bash
               sha256sum -c sha256sums.txt
               ```

               **NOTICE**: You might see `No such file or directory` warning
               which is fine as long as there is an `OK` in front of the
               archive you've downloaded.

            2. Extract the downloaded archive.

               - Gzip

               ```bash
               tar -xzf climan-darwin-[ARCH].tar.gz
               ```

               - Zip

               ```bash
               unzip climan-darwin-[ARCH].zip
               ```

            3. Install the included files

               ```bash
               cd climan-darwin-[ARCH]
               sudo install -Dm755 bin/climan /usr/local/bin/climan
               ```

            ### üêå Windows

            1. Verify checksums.

               - Gzip

               ```powershell
               Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path climan-windows-[ARCH].tar.gz
               ```

               - Zip

               ```powershell
               Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -Path climan-windows-[ARCH].zip
               ```

               Now check if output of the previous command matches the
               corresponding line of `sha256sums.txt`.

            2. Extract the downloaded archive.

            3. Append `%USERPROFILE%\bin` to `Path` environment variable.

            4. Install the included files

               ```powershell
               Set-Location -Path climan-windows-[ARCH]
               Copy-Item -Path bin\climan.exe -Destination %USERPROFILE%\bin\climan.exe
               ```
          files: |
            *.tar.gz
            *.zip
            sha256sums.txt
